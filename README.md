This repository demonstrates a common error in Tcl when dealing with empty strings and arithmetic operations. The `bug.tcl` file contains the erroneous code.  The `bugSolution.tcl` file offers a corrected version.  The problem arises from attempting mathematical operations directly on an empty string, which Tcl interprets differently from a numeric 0.
